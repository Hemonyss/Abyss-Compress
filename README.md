# Abyss compression algoritm

## Description
This project is a compression algorithm designed specifically for systems that require maximum decompression speed with a good compression ration and minimal system requirements, as well as maximum simplicity. The algorithm is based on RLE, so it is ideal for compressing executable files.

## Future plans
1. Add a full-fledged GUI that allows not only developers but also ordinary people to use the algoritm.
2. Add new compression modes that provide greater compression ratios with similar decompression speeds.
3. Increase the compression speed by making the compression algorithm multiprocessor

## required libraries
1. Numba
2. NumPy
