# Abyss compression algoritm

## About the project

### Description

Abyss Compress is a compression algorithm designed to compress executable files. Due to its simplicity, it is able to provide a fairly good speed while consuming minimal resources.

### Our goals
- Maximum simplicity and openness
- A speed that can compete with other algorithms
- High compression ratio
